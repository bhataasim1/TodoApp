# Todo App with React + Typescript

## Description
This is a simple todo app built with React and Typescript. It uses the browser's local storage to store the todos. The app is responsive and works on mobile devices as well.

The Project is Created just to have an Idea about the **ContextAPI in Reactjs**

The Video Tutorial that i followed to build this app is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KQeopPE36I&list=PLu71SKxNbfoDqgPchmvIsL4hTnJIrtige&index=14). it is a great tutorial for beginners to learn React with Javascript.
